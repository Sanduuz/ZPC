READ EVERYTHING BEFORE DOING ANYTHING.

Linux:
    If you are using linux, I assume you don't need this. But just in case, here are the instructions.
    -----
    1. Setting up Python
        - To do this, simply type in `python --version`. See if the version matches 2.*.*. If the version is 3.*.*, try out `python2 --version`.
          If you get an error saying python or python2 is not installed. Install python, but first make sure the packages are updated.
          Run these commands, `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y`, `sudo apt-get install python`,
          `sudo apt-get install python2`.
          If everything went smoothly, python should now be installed. Check if python is version 2.*.*. (python --version or python2 --version)
            (Note: ZPC is tested in Python 2.7.13)
    2. Running ZPC.py
        - Just run `python ZPC.py` or `python2 ZPC.py`. To get additional info try the help flag. (`python ZPC.py -h` or `python2 ZPC.py -h`)
          (See basic usage from README.md)

Windows:
    1. Setting up Python
        - If you have python2 installed and set to the PATH, just run `python ZPC.py`.
          To install Python, head on to https://python.org and download python2. (I'd recommend python2.7.13)
          Choose to add python to PATH and go on with the installation process.
    2. Setting Python to PATH
        - If you chose to add python to PATH on the installation, you can skip this step.
          Go to, 'My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables', and search for a variable called PATH.
          Edit the Environment Variable called PATH and add `;C:\Python27` to the end. (`;C:\Python*version number*`, for example, if I have
          Python 2.2 installed, I would add `;C:\Python22` in the end of PATH.) This step might be confusing, so feel free to message me on
          Instagram @sanduuz or E-mail me 19jdmz5js@protonmail.ch. If there is no Environment Variable called PATH found, create a new one
          and name it as 'PythonPath'. The value of PythonPath should be `C:\Python27`. [Note: The semicolon (;) at the beginning of C:\Python27,
          is just if there isn't a semicolon in the first place. The semicolons separate the values from eachother.]
    3. Running ZPC.py
        - If everything went smoothly so far, you can check whether everything is correctly set up by opening up CMD.exe or Powershell.exe, and
          typing in python. If you have set up the Python correctly to the PATH, an interactive python shell should open up. To exit the shell,
          type `exit()`. Now if you got everything correct so far, you can start using ZPC.
        - Change directories on CMD.exe or Powershell.exe to the directory where ZPC is located. (cd C:\Path\To\ZPC).
          Run ZPC by typing on CMD.exe or Powershell.exe `python ZPC.py`. To see additional help, run `python ZPC.py -h`.

AND THERE YOU GO, FULL INSTRUCTIONS OF HOW TO SET UP ZPC.
